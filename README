An evolving project to develop an HA controller based on zoned Arduino Megas with Ethernet shields.

Vision is for each Arduino to be configured using an on-startup JSON file detailing the sensors and 
rule-set for decision-making, and then to act as a web server supporting a browser front-end access 
using dynamic HTML and Ajax technologies. Multiple sensors need to be monitored/controlled, so 
supplementary hardware will be used to handle multiple interrupts, activate relays etc, and slave 
ATMega328s used to handle asynchronous data input

Uploads so far limited to WAKEUP library with examples.
